# SpaceMouse - Core

This package contains the platform-agnostic parts of the SpaceMouse library.

*You should not be importing this package directly, instead you'll want to use one of the wrapper libraries to provide the appropriate HID bindings for your target platform, see [https://github.com/nytamin/spacemouse](https://github.com/nytamin/spacemouse)*
